# Decision Control Instruction<br>
As we all need to alter our actions on the basis of changing situations in our day to day lives.For e.g.  If the weather is fine, then I will go for a stroll. If 
the highway is busy, I would take a diversion.
Similarily in programming ,We need to perform diff actions in diff scenarios. Till now ,we have used sequence control instruction in which the various statements are executed 
sequentially<br>
Many times we want a set of instructions to be executed in one situation and entirely different set of instructions to be executed in another condition this kind of situation is dealt in C program using decision control instruction.<br>
So in C ,we have three decision making instructions:<br>
 1. ## if  statement <br>
 2. ## if-else   <br>
 3. ## switch-case statement <br>
