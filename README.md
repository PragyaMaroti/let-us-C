# let-us-C
we humans communicate with each other with a certain medium ,wihch is the language we speak<br>
Similarily, How do you think we communicate with a computer?<br>
A computer has its own set of instructions what we call computer language<br>
1. low level language -
 Machine language- language of 0 and 1 ,  understandable by the machine ,basically interacts with the hardware <br>
 Assembly language - Assembly language uses a mnemonic to represent each low-level machine instruction or opcode//instead of 0&1 we use english words ,names and symbols <br>
Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler.
2. High level language - lang like C,C++,JAVA etc<br>

Four important aspects of any programming language:/<br>
how it stores data <br>
how it operates on data<br>
how the exact sequence of instruction works<br>
input and output methods <br>

C language is simple,reliable and easy to use and it has survived for more than three decades in an industry wheren newer languages and technologies emerge and vanish day in and day out .<br>
Why learn C :eyeglasses: when we have C++,Java,Python in trend?<br>
:sunglasses: In order to be good with programming ,one should have a good hold over C as it is reliable ,simple and basic.So it makes more sense to first learn C and then migrate to C++, C# and Java. Though this two-step learning process may take more time,but at the end of it you will definitely find it worth the trouble.<br>

:sunglasses:  major parts of popular OS like UNIX,LINUX and Android is written in C .And when it comes to performance (speed of execution) nothing beats C.<br>
:sunglasses: The devices we use like oven ,microwave,washing machines ,cameras ,their microprocessors,os and embedded system are written in C programs run fast .<br>
:sunglasses:  GAME DEVELOPMENT :  Many popular gaming frameworks (like DirectX) have been built using C due its high execution speed .<br>


# LEARNING C , LET'S BEGIN :computer:<br>
when we start learning english in our childhood ,we always start from learning alphabets ,then words ,then we from sentences ,sentences to form paragraphs<br>
Similarily in C :<br> 
Alphabets(A-Z,a-z),special symbols,numbers(0-9) :point_right: reserve words/constants/identifiers :point_right: instructions :point_right: program/code<br>
 **Constants,reserve words and variables<br>**
 . A constant is an entity that doesnâ€™t change: two types : primary and secondary constants <br>
 In PRIMARY constants ,we have integer contant(no commas,blank spaces ,no decimal points,no other symbols) <br>
 real constant(must have a decimal point)<br>
   :nerd_face::nerd_face: when the real number is so too large ,it can be expressed in exponential form : mantissa and exponent part(-3.4e38 to 3.4e38) e or E <br>
   
 character constant: a single alphabet, a single digit or a single special symbol enclosed within single inverted commas.('A' , '6') <br>
 
 
 C VARIABLES : rules of naming to be followed(max length of var can be 247 :dizzy_face: ,but we make shorter and meaningful names)<br>
  KEYWORDS : 32 <br>
